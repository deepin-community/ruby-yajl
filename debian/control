Description: Ruby interface to Yajl, a JSON stream-based parser library
 Supported features include,
 .
 JSON parsing and encoding directly to and from an IO stream
 (file, socket, etc) or String. Compressed stream parsing and
 encoding supported for Bzip2, Gzip and Deflate.
 .
 Parse and encode *multiple* JSON objects to and from streams or strings
 continuously.
 .
 JSON gem compatibility API - allows yajl-ruby to be used as a drop-in
 replacement for the JSON gem
 .
 Basic HTTP client (only GET requests supported for now) which parses JSON
 directly off the response body *as it's being received*
